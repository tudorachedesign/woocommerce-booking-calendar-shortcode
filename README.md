# WooCommerce Bookings Form Shortcode

A simple solution to display the WooCommerce Bookings form anywhere on your product page using a shortcode.

## Description

This modification allows you to move the WooCommerce Bookings calendar and booking form from its default position (near the add to cart button) to any location on your product page or even on other pages using a simple shortcode.

## Features

- Move the booking form to any location using `[booking_calendar]` shortcode
- No additional styling - maintains original WooCommerce Bookings appearance
- Preserves all original functionality (AJAX, validation, pricing calculations)
- Compatible with WooCommerce Bookings 1.10.0+
- Can display booking forms from other products using product ID

## Installation

### Method 1: Template Override

1. Create the following directory structure in your theme:
   ```
   your-theme/
   └── woocommerce-bookings/
       └── templates/
           └── single-product/
               └── add-to-cart/
                   └── booking.php
   ```

2. Copy the modified `booking.php` file into this directory

3. Add the shortcode function to your theme's `functions.php` file

### Method 2: Child Theme (Recommended)

1. If using a child theme, create the same directory structure in your child theme folder
2. Add the code to your child theme's `functions.php`

## Usage

### Basic Usage
Place this shortcode wherever you want the booking form to appear:
```
[booking_calendar]
```

### Display a Specific Product's Booking Form
```
[booking_calendar product_id="123"]
```

### Example Implementations

#### In Product Description
```html
<h2>Book Your Adventure</h2>
<p>Select your preferred date and time below:</p>

[booking_calendar]

<h2>Important Information</h2>
<p>Please arrive 15 minutes before your scheduled time...</p>
```

#### In a Custom Tab
```php
// Add to functions.php
add_filter( 'woocommerce_product_tabs', 'add_booking_tab' );
function add_booking_tab( $tabs ) {
    $tabs['booking'] = array(
        'title'    => __( 'Book Now', 'woocommerce' ),
        'priority' => 50,
        'callback' => 'booking_tab_content'
    );
    return $tabs;
}

function booking_tab_content() {
    echo do_shortcode('[booking_calendar]');
}
```

#### In a Separate Section
```html
<div id="availability">
    [booking_calendar]
</div>
```

## File Structure

```
├── booking.php          # Modified template file
├── functions.php        # Shortcode registration code
└── README.md           # This file
```

## Very Important
You should remove the classic "add to cart" widget from the "bookable" products to avoid having calendars in multiple positions. So use some dynamic visibility on the specific product type then put the shortcode wherever you prefer.
